## __Design Choices__

* Color Scheme
  - The four non-colors that I chose reflect the artist's passion for shooting raw, black and white photography. The palette creates a calm environment that brings out the photographies displayed by enhancing contrast.

![Color Palette](https://github.com/alexandruvalentin/Bragovski/blob/main/docs/palette.png)

* Typography

  * One general font was used for this project, with a ```serif``` fallback.
    * [Fjalla One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fjalla+One).

* Media
  
  * Images used are relevant to the purpose of the website.
  * All images have been resized and compressed in order to boost UX flow.

* Iconography
  * Icons have been used throughout the website in order to boost UX efficiency.

# 5. Testing

 - ### Click [here](TEST.md) for the full testing process.
 

# 6. Deployment

- ### Clone the Project

To make a local clone, follow the steps: 
1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [repository](https://github.com/alexandruvalentin/Bragovski). 
2. Click on the green button with the text **“Code”.**
3. Click on **“Open with GitHub Desktop”** and follow the prompts in the GitHub Desktop Application or follow the instructions from **[this link](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop)** for more detailed information.


- ### Local Machine
1. Install all the requirements: Go to the workspace of your local copy. In the terminal window of your IDE type: **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**.
2. Set up the environment variables: 
    - Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of the project. 
    - Create a `.env` file. This will contain the following environment variables:

    ```
    Import os
    os.environ("SECRET_KEY", "Added by developer")
    os.environ("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "Added by developer")
    os.environ("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "Added by developer")
    os.environ("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "Added by developer")
    ```
    - Add the `.env` file to the `.gitignore` file.
    **NOTE:** See more in the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys) to read more about setting the API key.
3. Migrate the models to create the database by the following commands:
    - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python3 manage.py migrate`
4. Load the data fixtures for categories and product in this exact order:
    - `python3 manage.py loaddata categories`
    - `python3 manage.py loaddata products`
5. Create a superuser. The superuser has acces to the admin environment.
    - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
    - Enter desired username, email and password.
6. Run the app: Open your terminal window in your IDE. Type: `python3 manage.py runserver` and run the app.
7. To acces the admin environment, you can add `/admin` to the end of your url and login with the superuser.


- ### Heroku Deployment
1. Set up local workspace for Heroku 
    - In terminal window of your IDE type: `pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt.` (The file is needed for Heroku to know which file to install.)
    - Create a Procfile with the following text: `web: gunicorn <name app>.wsgi:application` (The file is needed for Heroku to know which file is needed as entry point.)
    - Push all these files to your GitHub repository.
2. Set up Heroku
    - Create a Heroku account and create a new app and select your region. 
    - Go to resources in Heroku and search for **postgres**. Select **Hobby dev - Free** and click on the provision button to add it to the project.
    - Go to the settings app in Heroku and go to **Config Vars**. Click on **Reveal Config Vars** and add the following config variables:

    | KEY            | VALUE         |
    |----------------|---------------|
    | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<aws access key>`  |
    | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<aws secret access key>`  |
    | DATABASE_URL| `<postgres database url>`  |
    | EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
    | EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<email address>`  |
    | SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
    | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
    | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
    | STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
    | USE_AWS | `True`  |

3. Set up Database
    - Copy the **DATABASE_URL** (Postgres URL) from the config variables of Heroku and past it into the default database in `setting.py`

    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<DATABASE_URL here>")
    }
    ```
    **NOTE:** This setup for the databases is temporary for deployment to Heroku.
    - Migrate the models to create the database by the following commands:
        - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
        - `python3 manage.py migrate`
    - Load the data fixtures for categories and product in this exact order:
        - `python3 manage.py loaddata categories`
        - `python3 manage.py loaddata products`
    - Create a superuser. The superuser has acces to the admin environment.
        - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
        - Enter your username, email and password.
    - Now you can remove the DATABASE_URL from `settings.py` and set the 'old' default DATABSE settings.
    - Adjust the ALLOWED_HOSTS in you settings.py with the following:
    
    ```
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<your Heroku app URL>', 'localhost]
    ```
    - Push the code to Github.

4. Connect with Heroku 
    - Click on the **Connect to GitHub** section in the deploy tab in Heroku. 
        - Search your repository to connect with it.
        - When your repository appears click on **connect** to connect your repository with the Heroku. 
    - Set automatic deploment: Go to the deploy tab in Heroku and scroll down to **Aotmatic deployments**. Click on **Enable Automatic Deploys**. By **Manual deploy** click on **Deploy Branch**.
Heroku will receive the code from Github and host the app using the required packages. 
Click on **Open app** in the right corner of your Heroku account. The app wil open and the live link is available from the address bar. 

- ### Hosting static and media files with AWS
The static and media files are hosted in the AWS S3 Bucket. To host them you will need an account and create an S3 bucket and set a group, policy and user in the IAM environment. 
Read more about the the S3 Bucket storage [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). For more information about the storage in your project [click here](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).
