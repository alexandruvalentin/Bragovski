## __Design Choices__

* Color Scheme
  - The four non-colors that I chose reflect the artist's passion for shooting raw, black and white photography. The palette creates a calm environment that brings out the photographies displayed by enhancing contrast.

![Color Palette](https://github.com/alexandruvalentin/Bragovski/blob/main/docs/palette.png)

* Typography

  * One general font was used for this project, with a ```serif``` fallback.
    * [Fjalla One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fjalla+One).

* Media
  
  * Images used are relevant to the purpose of the website.
  * All images have been resized and compressed in order to boost UX flow.

* Iconography
  * Icons have been used throughout the website in order to boost UX efficiency.
